# A Bayesian time Dependent Poisson Model for excess mortality during the first weeks of COVID-19 pandemics
We investigate the relationship between the excess mortality observed in 2020 and reported COVID-19 deaths in four European countries. We estimate a time dependent Poisson model for excess deaths in Belgium, France, England & Wales and Norway with stan. We conclude to the existence of excess deaths on top of COVID-19 reported deaths for several weeks and
countries during the outbreak period.
